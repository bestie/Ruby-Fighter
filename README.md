# Ruby Fighter

## TL;DR
I'm a Street Fighter nerd, I wanted to build a Street Fighter II clone.

## Description

This is a fun but now dead experiment I did a long time ago.

Ruby implementation of the classic Capcom game Street Fighter II.

I'd love this to one day be feature complete with some interesting AI but really this is just a spike I thought I'd share to show a few people.

For now I hope you have lots of fun punching and crouching.

## Features that work
* Movement along the x-axis only.
* Crouching.
* Punching.
* Damage detection and health bar.
* Text in irony-drenched comic sans.
